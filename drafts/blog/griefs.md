why am i feeling this way , there must be a reason why?
success is there only because there is a notion of failure.
God is making me go through this phase because he wants to teach me something ,
he wants me to learn that one thing and unless i am acquainted with that knowledge this cycle will not end , good days won't come .

here i am going to list some of the things which excites me

1. machine learning systems
2. distributed machine learning
3. learning ml techniques

now the resistance that come in the way are all mental resistance :

1. lazy
2. procrastination
3. anxiety
now these three come because i am in DOUBT

doubt that what if this is not my way, what if i am built for backend dev and not this .
is this another useless side quest ?

i need a guide
what should i do
i dont know

these are the questions i think of all the time

the soft comfort of watching motivational reels is toxication

now let me tell you i am not interested in money:

i wanna do hard stuff
i wanna do things which satisfy my soul
i wanna be really good in systems programming

now you must be saying , then why not , why cant you work

YES i am wrong for not being very obsessed and hard working , but I am mentally sick of this state of mind that i am in , i don't have a stick to hold , i am walking and walking endlessly , sometimes i think only if i had a job maybe i would be enough motivated to work.

i have not given up, i will rise, i will learn this thing; God wants me to learn

watch me lose , multiple times until i win.
