It's been a while since I've updated this. I'm currently focused on a few key areas.

- Working on [beluga](https://github.com/rajiknows/beluga), a fast and simple static site generator.
- Exploring the world of distributed systems and their applications in blockchain.
- Reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann.
- Coding with Rust and exploring its ecosystem.
