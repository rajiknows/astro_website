                <div class="text-2xl">how i started programming</div>
                <p>I started programming in my first year of graduation. Before that, in my high school days i was introduced with python and earlier to that maybe Html.
                I started with C programming language , because it was the first language being taught in college. i learned the fundamentals in C which in my opinion is the best way to get into learning programming , at that time i used to struggle a lot in understatnding pointers.
                then i started to solve some hackerrank problems because it was cool at that time ... by this time llms weren't famous , chatgpt came into our college later on . on the side i used to learn web-dev , html ,css , js .. but nothing actually happened in first year. 
                in the second year i decided to join a cohort and learn web-dev seriously , so i joined harkirat's cohort and learned react, nodejs, databases, made a lot of projects. but the inflection came when i decided to revisit my old thought of becoming a blockchain dev . i did not know shit about blockdhains and anything , so i started diving deep , watched  a lot of videos and came across a language called `Rust` and it felt like something i wanted from so long ,  without even knowing about rust , i fell in love with the language , on the surface level it is very easy to understand rust, unless you dig deep or do certain things with it . since than i never left rust , i still programmed in js/ts but always came back to rust.. after the end of 2nd year i already knew the basics of rust and could easily make any small projects in it. In 2nd year i also learned Golang and did some small projects with it . basically whenever i was frustrated with rust i used to come to go . by this time i knew 4 languages and also did leetcode in c++ because of peer pressure. In third year i learned more about rust, memory , atomics , async etc , by this time i understood i had an intrest in low-level or systems programming. i was deeply fascinated to try out harder things , the things nobody played with. by the end of third year i decided to go for gsoc and i did but i was not very confident there.
